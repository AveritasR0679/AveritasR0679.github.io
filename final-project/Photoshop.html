                toolbars, and panels that give you quick access
                to a variety of tools and options for editing and adding elements to your image. You can also add

            <h1 class="lead sec-h1">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In Photoshop, we primarily work with
                bitmapped images which are continuous-tone images that have
                been converted into a series of small squares, or pictures elements, called pixels. You can also work
                with vector graphics, which
                are drawings made of smooth lines that retain their crispness when scaled;
                however, I usually create vectors in <a href="Illustration.html" target="_self">Adobe Illustrator</a>.

                    <p class="p-padding">
                        I am inclined to use vector graphics in my presentations and websites,
                        since I can zoom them in infinitely without having to worry about their resolution.
                        Another reason is that I am pretty skillful in Adobe Illustrator, a versatile application,
                        which can export not only vector files, but also raster files.

                    <p class="p-padding">
                        This assignment helped me clarify the difference between bitmaps (relatively more common) and
                        vectors, and
                        prompted me to explore a variety of software that can create these, whether to be open sourced
                        or paid.

                        <p class="p-padding">To make this collage, I employed various Photoshop tools, such
                            as the eraser tool, the blur tool, the dodge tool and many types of brushes. Amongst them I
                            used
                            the eraser tool to remove the parts I don't want from the original images, and connect them
                            seamlessly
                            with blur and smudge tools. Additionally, I also applied effects to some layers on the
                            artwork; for example,
                            outer glow and Gaussian blur were used on the glowing bubbles. I also adjusted the layer
                            blending mode
                            to make certain objects fit into the layers underneath them.</p>

                            Just a little tip for creating amazing illustrations without having to do much work. The
                            Photoshop brush tool
                            comes with a ton of default as well as advanced presets, but they might not be enough for
                            you. You can download free presets that are made by others on the Internet.

                            The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with some common Photoshop editing
                            tools. The collage
                            shown on the left side was composed through mainly eraser tool, transformation tool, and
                            some simple effects.
                            As long as you are familiar with the basic toolset, you will be more adept at creating
                            simple yet splendid artwork
                            like this one, and even explore the more advanced toolsets to create even better

                        <p class="p-padding">Masks isolate and protect parts of an image. When you create a mask based
                            on
                            a selection, the area you haven't selected is masked, or protected from editing. With masks
                            you can
                            create and save time-consuming selections and use them again. In addition, you can use masks
                            for
                            other complex editing tasks - applying color change and filters.</p>
                        <h2>Mask Types</h2>
                        <p class="p-padding">In Phososhop, you can make temporary masks, called quick masks, or you can
                            create
                            permanent masks and store them as special greyscale channels called alpha channels. You can
                            also manipulate
                            channels in the Channel Mixer which contains a bunch of pre-defined basic filters; by all
                            means, you can
                            add your own custom channel with a unique set of parameters as well.</p>
                        <h2>Comments:</h2>
                        <p class="p-padding">
                            In clipping masks, you don't necessarily have to use only white or black brushes to show or hide
                            pixels respectively. You can also utilize the gradient tool to emphasize a particular section of
                            an image with smooth transition to other sections of the image as shown in the picture on the left.

                            as a bag
                            When you convert a raster into a smart object, you are basically putting your image into a
                            "bag." No
                            matter how you alter the "bag," the stuff inside it will not be changed. In other words, you
                            are able
                            to activate and deactivate the changes and adjustments you've made.</p>

                            can edit
                            the smart object by directly applying the filter, which will not alter the original image.
                            If you wish to
                            edit the original file, you can double click on the smart object icon, which will open
                            another Photoshop
                            window where you can make all the necessary changes. After you're done, save the file. The
                            smart object
                            will be automatically updated.</p>
                        <h2>Comments:</h2>
                        <p class="p-padding">Smart objects are extremely easy to use when you are dealing with multiple
                            instances
                            of the object. When you make changes to the image within the smart object, the many

                            will be updated altogether without you manually editing them one by one.</p>

                        <p>How much retouching you do depends on the image yo're working on and your
                            goals for it. For many images, you may need only to change the resolution, lighten
                            the image, or repair a minor blemish. For others, you may need to perform several tasks
                            and employ more advanced tools and techniques.</p>

                        <p class="p-padding">A tip for retouching photos. Taking snapshots plays a pivotal role in
                            retouching photos for two reasons.
                            First, a snapshot can serve as a baseline for any future edits. If you are unsatisfied with
                            the result, you can just simply go
                            back to the snapshot you've taken without doing extra work to undo your steps. Second, you
                            are able to switch back and forth between
                            different snapshots you've taken to compare the original image with the edited one.</p>
